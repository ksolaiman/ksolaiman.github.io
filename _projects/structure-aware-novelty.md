description: "This project develops foundational methods to model, quantify, and adapt to novelty in intelligent systems. We study how classifiers behave under distributional shift, how domain complexity affects generalization, and how structural representations can support uncertainty-aware learning. Techniques span embedding-based signal fusion, selective abstention, and severity scoring for downstream response."
