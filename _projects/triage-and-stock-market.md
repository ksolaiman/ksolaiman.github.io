description: "This project explores how multimodal learning can improve decision-making in high-stakes domains like medical triage and stock market prediction. We model temporal and semantic signals — including vitals, news, and sentiment — to forecast outcomes under uncertainty. The research emphasizes cross-domain learning and robust performance on evolving, real-world data streams."
