# H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab  
### Human-Aligned, Resilient, Multimodal, Open-ended, Novelty-Informed Intelligence  
Led by **KMA Solaiman**, Assistant Teaching Professor, UMBC

---

## 🧭 Mission

The **H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab** is dedicated to designing robust AI systems that can perceive, adapt, and reason in dynamic, open-ended environments. We explore how **novelty**, **multimodal signals**, and **human intent** can be integrated into intelligent systems that make reliable, explainable decisions.

Our mission is to bridge **real-world uncertainty** with **resilient AI planning**, especially in domains where failure is costly — such as **smart infrastructure**, **critical care**, and **adaptive decision support systems**.

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

- **Novelty Detection & Characterization**  
  Detecting and interpreting out-of-distribution behaviors, events, and concepts in AI systems.

- **Multimodal Retrieval & Representation Learning**  
  Building robust retrieval and reasoning models across text, images, and structured data using hierarchical and graph-based techniques.

- **Resilient AI for Cyber-Physical Systems**  
  Applying AI to energy grids, healthcare monitoring, and sensing environments with a focus on graceful degradation and adaptive response.

- **Human-Centered Planning & Decision Support**  
  Designing explainable models that align with human expectations and allow control handoff under uncertainty.

## 🧪 Example Projects

- **Smart Grid Novelty Adaptation (2025)**  
  Predictive divergence-based framework for detecting novelty and adapting control strategies in electric grid systems. *(Poster presented at UMBC)*

- **FemmIR: Fine-Grained Multimodal Retrieval (2025)**  
  Hierarchical graph-based retrieval model for matching text-image-video triplets under open-world settings. *(In preparation)*

- **CPS2: Student-led Cyber-Physical Simulation for Adaptive AI**  
  A classroom-incubated project combining anomaly detection, novelty scoring, and severity clustering in sensor networks. *(In progress)*

## 🤝 Collaborations

We actively collaborate with faculty and researchers in:
- **Medicine & Public Health** (UMMC, UGA)
- **Decision Modeling & Biostatistics**
- **Energy Systems and Policy**
- **AI & Systems Research** (e.g., Purdue, MIT, USC-ISI)

If you're working on high-stakes domains where **novelty, robustness, and human-AI alignment** matter, we’d love to connect.
