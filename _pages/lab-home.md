## Designing AI That Endures

At the H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab, we design AI systems that think beyond narrow objectives â€” systems that **adapt, align, and reason** in complex, real-world environments. From smart grids to policy documents, from missing persons to triage prediction, our research spans multiple modalities and domains, bridging real-world applications with foundational AI challenges.

Our work is organized into **three core clusters**, each with its ongoing ðŸ“Œ [Projects](#projects) and real-world [Applications](#applications-we-explore):

- **Robust AI & Adaption to Novelty**  
  Detecting and reasoning about unseen or shifting inputs to ensure safe operation in dynamic settings.  
  ðŸ“Œ [Structure-Aware Novelty in Open-World AI](#structure-aware-novelty) â€¢ [Novelty-Aware Smart Electric Grids](#smart-electric-grid)  
  â€¢ [Unsupervised Clustering and Structure Discovery](#clustering-algos)

- **Multimodal Information Retrieval and Reasoning**  
  Aligning content across text, image, and graph modalities to enable open-world understanding.  
  ðŸ“Œ [Multimodal Information Retrieval and Alignment](#multimodal-information-retrieval) â€¢ [Motherboard Defect Detection](#motherboard-defect-detection)  
  â€¢ [Adaptive Prediction in Triage & Finance](#triage-and-stock-market)

- **Human-Centered Decision Systems**  
  Supporting real-world users with interpretable, context-aware AI for safety, health, and preferences.  
  ðŸ“Œ [Adaptive Prediction in Triage & Finance](#triage-and-stock-market) â€¢ [Human-Centered Reasoning](#human-centered-reasoning)

### Applications We Explore

- Electricity theft, anomaly detection, and triage in smart energy systems  
- Legal and policy document understanding  
- Intelligent triage and decision support in healthcare  
- Missing person retrieval and civic response systems  
<!-- - Mental health content support (exploratory)   -->
- Stock forecasting using news, sentiment, and historical signals  
- Fault and defect detection in hardware (e.g., motherboards)

## For Students

We welcome contributions from **UMBC undergraduates**, **independent study students**, and graduate students interested in AI research.

You may join the lab through:
- CMSC 499 / 699 / 799 research credits  
- Independent project work  
- Senior/honors thesis  
- Poster research under course mentoring (CMSC 471/478)

Recommended: background in Python and prior exposure to ML, AI, or data systems.  
Passion for experimental thinking and system design is more important than prior publications.
