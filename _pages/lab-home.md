## Welcome to the H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab  
**Human-Aligned, Resilient, Multimodal, Open-ended, Novelty-Informed Intelligence**

Lead: KMA Solaiman

At the H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab, we design AI systems that think beyond narrow tasks â€” systems that adapt, align, and reason across complex, real-world environments. From electricity grids to missing person search, from legal documents to triage prediction, our research spans modalities and domains, all grounded in one mission:

> To build resilient, multimodal AI that adapts to novelty and aligns with human needs.

### Our Research Focus

- **Novelty & Out-of-Distribution Detection**  
- **Multimodal Information Retrieval** (text, images, graphs, time series)  
- **Resilient Decision-Making in Smart Grids & CPS**  
- **Agent-Based Planning & Reinforcement Learning**  
- **Human-AI Interaction and Intent Modeling**

### Applications We Explore

- Electricity theft & operational anomaly detection  
- Legal and policy document understanding 
- Intelligent triage in healthcare systems  
- Missing person search  
- Mental Health Improvement
- Stock forecasting using multimodal signals  
- Fault detection in hardware systems (e.g., motherboards)
