## Designing AI That Endures

<!-- At the H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab, we design AI systems that are **resilient, multimodal, and human-aligned** â€” capable of adapting in complex, unpredictable environments. From electricity grids to missing person search, from triage prediction to civic intelligence tools, our research bridges real-world applications with foundational AI challenges. -->
<!-- all grounded in one mission: -->
<!-- > **To build resilient, multimodal AI that adapts to uncertainty and aligns with human needs.** -->
<!-- At our core is a mission:
> **To build AI that endures â€” not just performs.** -->
At the H.A.R.M.O.N.I. Lab, we design AI systems that think beyond narrow  objectives â€” systems that **adapt, align, and reason** in complex, real-world environments. From smart grids to policy documents, from missing persons to triage prediction, our research spans multiple modalities and domains, bridging real-world applications with foundational AI challenges.
Our work is organized into **three core clusters**:

- **Robust AI & Novelty Adaptation**  
  Systems that detect, reason about, and adapt to unseen or shifting inputs â€” ensuring safe operation in dynamic settings.

- **Multimodal Reasoning & Retrieval**  
  Models that align and retrieve across diverse modalities like text, image, and graph, enabling open-world understanding.

- **Human-Centered Decision Systems**  
  AI that supports people â€” through interpretable recommendations, public-facing tools, and behavior-aware design, spanning from public safety to triage to preference matching.

## For Students

We welcome contributions from **UMBC undergraduates**, **independent study students**, and graduate students interested in AI research.

You may join the lab through:
- CMSC 499 / 699 / 799 research credits  
- Independent project work  
- Senior/honors thesis  
- Poster research under course mentoring (CMSC 471/478)

Recommended: background in Python and prior exposure to ML, AI, or data systems.  
Passion for experimental thinking and system design is more important than prior publications.
